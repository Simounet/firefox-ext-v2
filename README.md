# wallabag

wallabag is an open-source and self-hosted alternative to Pocket, Instapaper, etc.

## Installation

Go to https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/wallabag-v2/ and add the wallabag extension to Firefox.

Then, go to your wallabag v2 instance, in the menu go to "Developer", then "Create a new client", put a random redirect URI (`http://localhost` for example), copy the Client ID and the Client secret in the wallabag extension configuration (visit `about:addons`). You also need to put your wallabag URL without the trailing slash.
